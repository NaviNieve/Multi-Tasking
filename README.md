# Multi-Tasking

![alt text](https://github.com/NaviNieve/Multi-Tasking/blob/assets/octopus.png?raw=true)

This is a Fixed and reuploaded the abandoned mod "Multitasking" by "NotCorgan" for Melvor Idle Version 1.2.2.
Description:

"Allows you to train all active skills at once." - NotCorgan

 

Features:

✔️Enable / ❌Disable Mod

💪 Offline Multi-Tasking 💪

❇️ Works with any other mod ❇️

 

🔢Allow all skills to be trained🔢

OR

👑Allow Combat and 1 Non-Combat Skill to be trained (Less Broken)👑

 

Notes:

✔️ Cartography should work, but I was also not able to reproduce any errors during my testing. ✔️ 

✔️ Goblin Raid will make it look like it stops all tasks, but it will treat you as if you were offline and give you all the experience after the Raid or when pausing the Raid. ✔️ 

 

Tested On:

<Game: Melvor Idle><Version: 1.2.2><Platform: 🖥Steam><Status: ✅Working>

 

Conflicts:

None!😎

Also, not tested thoroughly with other mods other than "SEMI" mods and small things like Township, and such...
